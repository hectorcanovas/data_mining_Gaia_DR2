Software:
* 01_explore_eps.ipynb >> Explore EPS curves for the 3 scaling factors explored in directory "cl_scale/" (Standard, MinMax, Robust)/
* 02_test_eps.ipynb  >> Examine the step-like change in a k-distance plot. Applies derivatives method to find the slope changes to find the EPS for a given mPts.
* 03_plot_eps.ipynb  >> Creates paper figure showing 3 representative K-distance plots and a zooming with the step-like change.
* 04_plot_multi_dbscan_results.ipynb >> Plots DBSCAN outputs for 3 representative cases (spatial distribution, and histograms in parallax & proper motions)
