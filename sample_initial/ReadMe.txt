Abstract:
    The Ophiuchus cloud complex is one of the best laboratories to study the
    earlier stages of the stellar and protoplanetary disc evolution. We
    constructed a control sample composed of 188 bona fide Ophiuchus members.
    Using this sample as a reference we applied three different density-based
    machine learning clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, OPTICS, and HDBSCAN) to a
    sample drawn from the Gaia DR2 catalogue centred on the Ophiuchus cloud
    that contains 2300 sources covering a sky area of 38deg^2. The
    clustering analysis was applied in the five astrometric dimensions defined
    by the three-dimensional Cartesian space and the proper motions in right
    ascension and declination. The three clustering algorithms systematically
    identify a similar set of candidate members in a main cluster with
    astrometric properties consistent with those of the control sample. We
    constructed a common sample containing 391 member candidates including 166
    new objects, which have not yet been discussed in the literature. We built
    the SEDs for a subset of 48 objects and found a total of 41 discs.

Description:
    This table contains the initial sample described in Sect. 2.1 of the
    article.
