# Data Mining the Gaia DR2 catalogue
This repository contains the set of codes & data used for the article Canovas et al. 2019 A&A in press.
In this study we applied different Machine Learning (density-based clustering) algorithms to a sample drawn
from the Gaia DR2, centred on the Ophiuchus Star Forming Region. As a result of our analysis we dicover
a population of objects that share astrometric (spatial and kinematics) coordinates consistent with those
of the bonafide Ophiuchus memmbers. If confirmed, this population will increase the census of Oph members
by 40% - 50%
